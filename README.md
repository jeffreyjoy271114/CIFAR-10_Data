# CIFAR-10_Data
The CIFAR dataset contains 60,000 images across 10 classes, widely used for training machine learning models in image classification.
We are leveraging this dataset to develop and enhance algorithms for object recognition, focusing on optimizing model accuracy and generalization. Our process includes image preprocessing, applying various classification techniques, and evaluating model performance across different categories.
